I’ve created a web app that automatically crops images for Nikke.

# Conditions:
- Only works in Full HD (1920x1080) resolution
- Might only be compatible with the English language UI

# Known Issues:
- Tested with Crown, Alice, S.Anis, M.Priv, and Emilia (the ones I have fully upgraded). Cropping may not be accurate for other characters.

# How to Use:
- The quickest method is shown in the video linked below.

Note: If your characters aren’t fully overloaded, you’ll need to upload them individually for a clean version. If you don’t mind a less clean version, you can skip this.


If you run into any problems, feel free to post your results and let me know what options you selected—basically, you’re my beta tester right now, lol. I’ll fix them if I have time. 
Don’t expect too much, though—it’s my first web app.
